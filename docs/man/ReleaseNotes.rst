Release Notes
=====================

tRIBS Distributed Hydrologic Model, Version 5.2.0, represents a culmination of efforts and significant improvements from the initial release [#]_ and later versions [#]_, [#]_. This latest version includes new physical processes related to level-pool reservoir routing [#]_ and channel transmission losses [#]_. In addition, the latest updates (Version 5.0 and onward) entail a CMake build system ,  major code improvements, including a refactored snow module, fixed memory leaks in parallel mode, and updates to C++ 17 standards.
