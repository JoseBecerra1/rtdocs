Open Source Frame Work
----------------------
tRIBS is available as an open source software both through `GitHub <https://github.com/tribshms/tRIBS>`_ and a docker image is maintained on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tribs/tribs/general>`_. One of the benefits of open source software is that the underlying code is available for anyone to inspect, modify, debug, and fix. We provide information on using Git Hub here, Docker here, and if you are interested in contributing to the tRIBS code base outline
