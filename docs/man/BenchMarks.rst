Benchmark Datasets
=====================

Benchmark datasets are publicly available and hosted permanently on Zenodo, under version control and with an assigned digital object identifier (DOI). These examples are provided for a user to test the model execution against a previously-derived set of model outputs. The contents of the benchmark datasets are described both on Zenodo and the accompanying README file, which contains simple instructions for running tRIBS. first benndemonstrates the application of tRIBS in serial mode at a point-scale, whereas the second is a basin-scale simulation that can be executed in serial or parallel mode.


The accompanying README file also contains simple instructions for running tRIBS on the individual benchmark.
