Templates
=========
The tRIBS model setup can be facilitated by inspecting prior model runs, including the format of the main text file (Input File ``*.in``) used to input information to the model, as well as example files for gridded or text-based inputs. The tRIBS :doc:`Benchmarks` provide useful examples. Below are some useful templates.
