Benchmark Datasets
=====================

Benchmark datasets are publicly available and hosted permanently on Zenodo, under version control and with an assigned digital object identifier (DOI). These examples are provided for a user to test the model execution against a previously-derived set of model outputs. The contents of the benchmark datasets are described both on Zenodo and the accompanying README file, which contain simple instructions for running tRIBS. The point-scale benchmark dataset demonstrates the application of tRIBS in serial mode, whereas the basin-scale benchmark dataset is a simulation that can be executed in either serial or parallel mode. 

These examples are for forested regions in northern Arizona with warm and cold season hydrologic processes. As such, these cases test a wide range of the model physics for interception, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, snowpack dynamics and streamflow. Nevertheless, not all of the model capabilities are executed in the benchmark datasets and a model user needs to exercise caution when changing model inputs or altering the selected procesess. 

Additional benchmark datasets will be addded here as these are released via Zenodo.
