BenchMarks
=====================

Currently we provide two publicly available benchmark datasets which are hosted on Zenodo. The first demonstrates the application of tRIBS in serial mode at a point-scale, whereas the second is a basin-scale simulation that can be executed in serial or parallel mode.

The contents of the benchmarks are described both on Zenodo and the accompanying README file.
The accompanying README file also contains simple instructions for running tRIBS on the individual benchmark.
