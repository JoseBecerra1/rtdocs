Distributed Hydrologic Model *tRIBS*
=====================================

The development of the tRIBS Model has been the result of hydrologic modeling and software
development efforts performed by various researchers in the Ralph M. Parsons Laboratory in the
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Model development continues at MIT and New Mexico Tech, among other partnering institutions.
This document is intended to serve as a user manual for the tRIBS Model, including instructions
on how to download, compile, set up and run tRIBS. In addition, an effort has been made to document
the model software design using class and workflow diagrams. This guide assumes that the reader is
familiar with the capabilities of the tRIBS Model and its intended purposes. More information
concerning the model can be obtained through the tRIBS Research Description and Publication List.

The **TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS)**, is fully
distributed model of hydrologic processes.

What type of processes does tRIBS model?
_________________________________________

The *tRIBS* model description can be found in [Ivanov_2004a]_, [Ivanov_2004b]_ and [Vivoni_2004]_.

We mention a few *tRIBS* processes it models:

- Couple the vadose and saturated zones with the dynamic water table.
- Moisture infiltration waves.
- Soil moisture redistribution.
- Topography-driven lateral fluxes in the vadose and groundtable zones.
- Computes the radiation and energy balance.
- Interception, evaporation and evpotrasnpiration.
- Hydrologic and hydraulic routing.
- other.
